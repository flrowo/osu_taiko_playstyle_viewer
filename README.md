# eae
basically a playstyle viewer

### installation
- for now, use load chrome's load unpacked functionality to load the src folder (later there is going to be a real release for it)

### known bugs
- when you go from a player's page to another through the osu!'s website navigation, the playstyle will be the same as the previous profile's playstyle
- in a beatmap's page, near the mapper's profile, the playstyle shouldn't show 2 times like that
