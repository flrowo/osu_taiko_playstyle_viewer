basically a playstyle viewer

### installation
- for now, simply use load chrome's load unpacked functionality to load the src folder (later, there will be an official release for it)

### adding/updating/deleting data
- you can contact me via discord (flrowo), or make a pull request here
- you cannot change other's data, only yours
- for now the data is inside the pack, so i need to update the repo to update the data

### known bugs
- when you go from a player's page to another through the osu!'s website navigation, the playstyle will be the same as the previous profile's playstyle
- in a beatmap's page, near the mapper's profile, the playstyle shouldn't show 2 times like that
